# Next.js & Cloudinary example app

This example shows how to create an image gallery site using Next.js, [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Why I made this:
I used this vercel template to get learn more about how to use cloudinary with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This was to get more familiar with cloudinary to hopefully use it for building a full stack photography portfolio as a later project. This project taught me how to integrate the cloudinary api into a Next.js project, I got more familiar with react and typescript as well which was something that I also wanted to learn more about.
